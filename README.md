# hangman 

- Greetings and welcome.  
- This was a project assignment for my JavaScript class. The program will pick a word from it's word bank.  You get to pick letters (a-z) that you believe match those in the selected word.  If you get the word right before you run out of guesses, YOU WIN.  Good luck and have fun.  

Prerequisites
- Copy my code into a fresh Visual Studio Code folder.  
- Name it hangman. 

Getting Started / Deployment 
- Once you have the code stored in under the name hangman, open your terminal.  
- Then type "node ." at the command line and hit enter.  
- This starts the game. Hitting (ctrl-c) ends the game.

Built With
- JavaScript - The framework used. 
- json - File format. 
- word-bank.json - For a battery of words to pull from for the game.
